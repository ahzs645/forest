## What Was NOT Broken

After thorough analysis, these systems were found to be working correctly:

✅ **Game Logic**
- State management
- Effect application
- Metric clamping
- Issue drawing
- Risk calculations
- Flag handling
- Scheduled issues

✅ **UI Components**
- Modal system
- Glossary functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Desktop layout
- Status panel
- Terminal output
- Choice handling

✅ **Data Integrity**
- All 4 roles have valid tasks
- All 6 areas properly configured
- All 28 issues properly tagged
- All 52 illegal acts structured correctly
- Glossary terms valid

## Known Limitations

1. **No Save System:** Game state resets on page reload
   - Could be added with localStorage in future

2. **Mobile Keyboard:** Number keys (1-9 shortcuts) may be hard to access on mobile
   - Touch buttons are the primary mobile input method

3. **Small Screens:** On very small devices (<360px), HUD text may be cramped
   - Game is optimized for 360px+ screens

4. **CLI Colors:** Require ANSI-compatible terminal
   - Works on all modern terminals
   - May need configuration on older Windows Command Prompt

## Conclusion

These improvements make the game:
1. ✅ Fully playable on both desktop and mobile
2. ✅ Easier to test with new CLI tool
3. ✅ More accessible on mobile devices

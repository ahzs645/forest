# BC Forestry Simulator: Future Directions

This document captures proposed enhancements to deepen replayability, balance risk, and add humour to the BC Forestry Simulator. The ideas are grouped by theme so it is easy to decide what to prototype next.

## Recently implemented highlights
- **Responsive risk plays.** Risk gambles now pull their success chances from live metrics, scale rewards accordingly, and rotate through multiple narrative outcomes so repeated wagers stay surprising.
- **Volatile Wildcards.** Illegal options roll between quiet wins, escalating heat, and full investigations—keeping the satire spicy without guaranteeing a payoff.
- **Seasonal newswire.** Each season now closes with a procedurally generated headline that reflects the biggest metric swings.
- **Expanded mischief deck.** New illicit entries like hiring Bigfoot or pitching a logging reality show keep the humour fresh.
- **Glossary & restart guard.** A modal glossary explains forestry jargon while restart requests now prompt for confirmation.

## Core systems and replayability
- **Expand the seasonal task pool.** Introduce additional tasks per role, seasonal rotations, and cross-discipline events so that each run surfaces different combinations of duties and challenges.
- **Dynamic risk calculations (live, keep tuning).** The base system now scales odds and payouts by metrics; future iterations could add gambit-specific curves or difficulty modifiers.
- **Persistent crews and scoreboards.** Let players save their crew history, compare runs, and view season-by-season metric deltas using the data the engine already collects.
- **Difficulty and career modes.** Layer in selectable modes (e.g., Rookie, Veteran, multi-year Campaigns) with tuned event frequency, thresholds, and scoring weights to accommodate different play styles.
- **Balanced Wildcard outcomes (live, expand consequences).** Wildcards now roll between mild, hot, and catastrophic results—follow-up work could add early run shutdowns or unique investigations.
- **Interconnected metrics.** Allow long-term neglect of one metric to spill over into others, encouraging players to anticipate downstream consequences.
- **Adviser personalities.** Add non-player advisers with their own priorities who occasionally nudge the player, rewarding or penalizing alignment with their guidance.
- **Additional tracking metrics.** Consider a morale or public perception bar that influences event severity or risk-play odds and gives players more levers to manage.

## Humour and presentation
- **Wilder Wildcards.** Continue growing the illicit library—the latest additions include Bigfoot labour contracts and carbon-offset spin.
- **Audio-visual flourishes.** Sprinkle in lightweight pixel art or ambience to accent key moments without losing the retro terminal charm.
- **Seasonal news headlines (live, broaden coverage).** Headlines now broadcast the biggest metric swings; future polish could add art or multi-line spreads.
- **Easter eggs.** Reward specific crew names or repeated illegal choices with hidden jokes and callbacks.
- **Mini-games.** Occasionally swap a task for a quick interactive challenge that pays out small bonuses to break up the text-driven flow.
- **Player journaling.** Allow players to jot quick notes each season and recap them at the end of the run for shareable stories.
- **Risk-play narration variety (live, add more voices).** Success and failure outcomes now draw from rotating decks; consider adding adviser-specific commentary next.

## User interface and accessibility
- **In-game glossary (live, add regional depth).** A modal glossary now explains forestry jargon—keep layering in region- and role-specific references.
- **Responsive layout polish.** Keep action buttons visible on small screens, add keyboard shortcuts, and consider collapsible panels for the status area.
- **Accessible palettes.** Pair colours with shapes or icons so colour-blind players can easily interpret the metric bars.
- **Restart confirmation (live).** Restarting now surfaces a confirmation modal so accidental ESC taps don't scrap the current run mid-season.

These ideas build on the simulator's strong foundation of educational content, satirical edge, and replayable structure. They provide a roadmap for future updates that can appeal to forestry professionals and curious newcomers alike.
